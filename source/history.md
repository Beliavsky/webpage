# Fortran-lang history

## Creation

The Fortran-lang project was started at the beginning of 2020 by Ondřej Čertík
and Milan Curcic
([[1]](https://ondrejcertik.com/blog/2021/03/resurrecting-fortran/),
[[2]](https://medium.com/modern-fortran/first-year-of-fortran-lang-d8796bfa0067)).
The effort built upon work of several members of the Fortran Standards
Committee that built a GitHub proposals repository to track proposals to the
Standards Committee, which lead to the creation of the Fortran Standard Library
(`stdlib`), the Fortran Package Manager (`fpm`) and the `fortra-lang.org`
website. The webpage quickly become the top result in major search engines for
"Fortran". We created a Fortran Discourse where the whole Fortran community can
meet and discuss, make announcements, ask for help, etc. The Fortran-lang
effort was joined by hundreds of contributors. At the end of 2022 the
Fortran-lang project was accepted under NumFOCUS for fiscal sponsorship.

## The Fortran Standard Library `stdlib`

Created in the late 2019 the Fortran Standard Library provides
a community driven and agreed upon de facto "standard" library for Fortran.
The library is a collection of modules that provide a wide range of
functionality, including: containers, sorting, searching, linear algebra,
unities, fast Fourier transforms, and more.

Find out more about `stdlib` on our [website](https://stdlib.fortran-lang.org/)
and on [GitHub](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib).

## Project migration to Fortran-lang

Over time crucial projects to the Fortran community were migrated to the
Fortran-lang organization to allow for community collaboration and to ensure
long-term sustainability of the projects.

### fftpack

### minipack

### test-drive

### vscode-fortran-support

<!-- Migration date: 22-04-2022 -->

Modern Fortran for Visual Studio Code is feature-rich Visual extension
for Fortran originally created by
Miguel Carvajal and maintained by Giannis Nikiteas.
The extension migrated in early 2022 to the Fortran-lang organization
to improve integration with other Fortran-lang projects such as `fpm`
and allow for easier community collaboration.

Find out more about Modern Fortran for Visual Studio Code on
[VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fortran-lang.linter-gfortran)
and on [GitHub](httos://github.com/fortran-lang/vscode-fortran-support).

### fortls

<!-- Migration date: 28-11-2022 -->

`fortls` is a Fortran language server created by Giannis Nikiteas
in late 2019. The project started as a fork of the
archived project `fortran-language-server` but quickly diverged from it
both in terms of features and codebase. The project migrated to the
Fortran-lang organization in late 2022 to allow for easier community
collaboration.

and on [GitHub](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortls).
